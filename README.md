# Screen space shadows

Implementation of screen space shadows in OpenGL. Final project for the Computer Graphics unit of
the Bachelor's in Videogames at Universidade LusÃ³fona.

**Screen space shadows** (also known as **contact shadows**) is a technique used to add extra shadow detail,
particularly around geometry that are very close to each other. It complements the more general
shadowmap technique.

For each light, a ray is marched (in view space) from the pixel to be drawn in the light's direction.
At each step, the ray's current position is compared to the value written on the depth buffer for that
position. If the ray's Z coordinate is greater (occluded from the camera), that pixel should be in shadow.
The render pipeline must include a pass for generating the depth buffer required by the algorithm.

This implementation was based on [Panos Karabelas' article about screen space shadows][SSSKarabelas].

The following is a screenshot of a scene rendered with only shadowmaps.

After enabling screen space shadows, some additional sharp shadowed areas are noticeable.

In this GIF, the effect is easier to see.

## Installation

It is possible nothing additional is needed, NuGet is used to pull the OpenTK project. In case something is needed:

## Usage

* Clone and use directly. Just need to change the function that is passed to the OpenTKApp.Run method to change the behaviour function.
